THE SCIENCE OF FINDING MYSELF

When she called me a snake,
A cold blooded creature,
Where then had the warmness that I knew from my childhood,
The same warmness that I had learnt to extend to everyone I meet,
Where is that young boy that loved and loved some more?,
That held his heart in his fist,
The kind voice that shook everyone he met,
The Bold Tenacity that hide confidently in there,
Have I killed him?,
Sacrificed him to this snake she speaks of,
Why, then am I the way I am?,
Has my life formula been altered over time?,
Did I get the ingredients wrong along the way?
A dash of Compassion flipped to a cup of Despair/Anguish,
For the thoughts of the past lingered, making on the past sweet.
Then tell me why do you act as you do?
Why would you hurt her?
Is it that you don’t know?
Nor understand the confines and perimeters of stepping out of a relationship.
Are you that bleak in sight?
The concept is lost to you.
Fix it…..No Learn it….No chisel it on your morality or so called virtues.
Maybe then you won’t forget…
Maybe….
Just maybe you will get not your past self….
But your true-self…..
